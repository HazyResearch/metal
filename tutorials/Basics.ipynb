    "The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce the basic pipeline, classes, and debugging/analysis tools in Snorkel MeTaL. In this notebook, we'll investigate a single-task problem with synthetic data, with an emphasis on the basic design concepts of MeTaL. Check out the `tutorials/` directory to see how this basic pipeline extends to the full _multi-task_ setting, and other topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial consists of four steps, following the basic [data programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723) pipeline as in [Snorkel](https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/):\n",
    "1. **Load Data:** In the _weakly supervised_ setting, we only have access to unlabeled data points `X`, matrix of noisy labels `L`, and dev/test labels `Y`*\n",
    "2. **Train Label Model:** The purpose of the `LabelModel` is to estimate the unknown accuracies of the labeling functions, _without access to `Y`_, and then use this to denoise and combine them into a set of _probabilistic training labels_.\n",
    "3. **Train End Model:** We can then use these training labels to supervise a discriminative classifier!\n",
    "4. **Evaluate:** We evaluate this model on a held-out test set\n",

For this synthetic problem, the trends in our data are fairly simple, so our model will begin to overfit very quickly. If we do begin to overfit and see our dev score go down, however, the best model seen at any epoch will be restored at the end of training."
